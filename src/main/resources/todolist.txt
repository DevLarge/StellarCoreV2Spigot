What we need from each plugin:

DeluxeHub - This plugin does chat timed announcements well. We need those in the jsonbroadcast format.
DeluxeAnnounce - This Plugin handles the Tab List configuration, we need that configuration.
ChatReactions - I want a copy of this plugin, in stellar core.
VoidWorld - this plugin hooks into Multiverse Core and generates a void world.
Banitem - This plugin needs to be able to ban specific items, based on group, region and permissions, for example
- Group Meaning, certain pex groups can't access certain items, region meaning in certain regions items can't be used
- Permission meaning certain staff perms cannot use certain items. Ex: Admin can't use NPC wand.
AltFinder - Plugin that identifies peoples alt accounts
AntiVPN - Plugin that doesn't allow VPNs
VanishPlugin - Plugin that vanishes staff without putting them in fucking invisibility 2.

ChatManager - A Plugin like ChatEX that can handle the chat formats.
WorldGuard - I'd like to change this plugin, so that we can make circular regions, this needs to be talked about, but it is open source.
CratesPlus - Crates Manager
GreatKits - Kits Manager
